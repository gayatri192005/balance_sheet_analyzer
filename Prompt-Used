### üí° **Prompt: Balance Sheet Analyzer for Banking Sector ‚Äì AI-Powered & UI-Enhanced**

Create an intelligent, interactive **Balance Sheet Analyzer web application focused on the banking sector**, designed to provide an effortless and visually engaging experience for users such as investors, auditors, analysts, and finance students. The platform must allow users to **upload bank balance sheets** in PDF, Excel, or CSV format and extract key financial data using **AI-powered OCR, NLP, and tabular parsing engines**. It should automatically identify and organize complex banking-specific fields like **assets (loans, reserves, investments)**, **liabilities (deposits, borrowings)**, and **equity components (capital, reserves, surplus)**, along with indicators like **Gross/Net NPAs, CRAR, Tier 1/Tier 2 Capital, Return on Assets (ROA), Cost-to-Income Ratio, and more**.

The web app should feature a **toggle switch** to switch between raw data view and AI-enhanced insights. It must have a **built-in assistant chatbot** that supports queries like ‚ÄúShow capital adequacy ratio trends from 2020‚Äì2024‚Äù or ‚ÄúHighlight major changes in liabilities‚Äù. The assistant should also offer proactive suggestions like potential risk flags, liquidity drop alerts, or unusual asset shifts. A **dark/light mode toggle** with animated transitions will enhance user comfort and engagement.

The UI must be **clean, minimalistic, and responsive**, built with modern design principles and components. Animations like **smooth card transitions, collapsible sections, number counters**, and **hover effects** should make the financial exploration journey intuitive and engaging. Key ratios and summaries should be visualized using **animated charts, radial progress indicators, and KPI cards**. A customizable dashboard should allow users to pin important widgets, filter periods, or compare multiple banks side-by-side.
